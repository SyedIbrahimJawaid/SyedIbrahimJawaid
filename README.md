# Syed Ibrahim Jawaid

I’m not trying to look like a senior developer.  
I’m trying to **become a good one**.

I’m a Software Enginering student learning how the web actually works —  
from JavaScript fundamentals to modern frontend frameworks.

## 🧭 How I Learn

I don’t rush stacks.  
I don’t memorize code.  
I don’t blindly copy tutorials.

Instead, I focus on:
- understanding *why* something works
- breaking things and fixing them
- building small, real, imperfect projects

This GitHub is a **learning log**, not a highlight reel.

## 🔍 What I’m Working On Right Now

- JavaScript fundamentals and working
- React
- Next.js for real-world structure
- UI animations & clean layouts using Tailwind CSS
- Building full stack applications for real-world experience

---

## 🛠 Tools I Use (and am learning properly)

- HTML & CSS  
- Tailwind CSS  
- React 
- Next.js (beginner → intermediate)  
- Git & GitHub
- Supabase
- Node js

I only list what I’ve actually used.

## 📁 Projects Philosophy

Every repository here exists for **one reason**:
> to understand a concept well enough to explain it to someone else.

That means:
- clear READMEs
- simple structure
- visible progress over time

More projects are coming as I improve.

## 📌 What You’ll See Here Over Time

- Small JavaScript projects with clear logic
- UI experiments and animations
- Experiencing full stack applications
