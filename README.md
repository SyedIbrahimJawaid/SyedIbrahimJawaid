# Syed Ibrahim Jawaid

I’m not trying to look like a senior developer.  
I’m trying to **become a good one**.

I’m a Software Engineering student learning how the web actually works —  
from JavaScript fundamentals to modern frontend frameworks.

## How I Learn

I don’t rush stacks.  
I don’t memorize code.  
I don’t blindly copy tutorials.

Instead, I focus on:
- understanding **why** something works
- breaking things and fixing them
- building small, real, imperfect projects

This GitHub is a **learning log**, not a highlight reel.

## Projects Philosophy

Every repository here exists for one reason:

> to understand a concept well enough to explain it to someone else.

That means:
- clear READMEs
- simple structure
- visible progress over time

More projects are coming as I improve.

## What You’ll See Here Over Time

- Small JavaScript projects with clear logic
- UI experiments and animations
- Full-stack applications built for real use cases
